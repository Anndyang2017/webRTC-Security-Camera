webRTC-Security-Camera
======================

a motion activated security camera that runs in the browser (Chrome/MacBook Pro required)

Uses deviceMotionEvents and deviceOrientationEvents plus getUserMedia to capture video from a device video camera, then grab a snapshot fromthe video stream when motion is detected.

This is offered purely as a proof of concept, so don't rely on it to save your home or office from theft! Please!
